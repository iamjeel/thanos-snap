Thanos Snap ✨
A fun React.js project inspired by the iconic Thanos Snap! This application demonstrates the random disintegration of half of the visible components on the screen, showcasing the power of React state management and conditional rendering.

📋 Features
Random Element Removal: Deletes 50% of the displayed components with a single click.
Interactive UI: Built with React.js for dynamic updates and a seamless user experience.
Customizable: Easily modify the components or logic to fit your needs.

🤔 How It Works
Randomization
The app uses a randomized selection to identify components for "disintegration."

State Management
React's state management is leveraged to conditionally render or remove components from the DOM.

Dynamic UI Updates
The app dynamically re-renders the UI when the state is updated, giving the effect of the snap.
